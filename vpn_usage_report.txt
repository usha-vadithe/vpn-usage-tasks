## 🔐 VPN Used:
ProtonVPN (Free Tier)

## 🧭 Steps Followed:
1. Signed up at protonvpn.com
2. Installed ProtonVPN desktop client on Windows
3. Connected to a Netherlands server using Quick Connect
4. Verified IP address changed using whatismyipaddress.com
5. Browsed securely through encrypted tunnel
6. Disconnected and compared speed & IP location

## 🌐 Screenshots Included:

## 🔍 What is a VPN?
A **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** encrypts internet traffic and routes it through a secure tunnel to protect privacy and bypass geographic restrictions.

## 🔑 Key Benefits:
- Hides IP address and location
- Encrypts all online activity

- Enables access to geo-blocked content

## ⚠️ Limitations:
- Slower speeds (especially with free VPNs)
- Some free VPNs may log user data
- Cannot guarantee complete anonymity
- Not a substitute for antivirus or firewall

## 📖 VPN Protocols Used:
- ProtonVPN uses **WireGuard**, **OpenVPN**, and **IKEv2** in the free version

## ✅ Outcome:
Learned how to set up and use a VPN, verified IP masking and encrypted browsing. Understood VPN use cases and limitations.
