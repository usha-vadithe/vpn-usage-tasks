# Task 8: Working with VPNs – Cyber Security Internship

## 🎯 Objective
Understand how VPNs function by installing and using a VPN client, verifying IP change, and analyzing privacy, performance, and security benefits.

## 🛠 Tool Used
- ProtonVPN (Free Plan)

## 🧪 Steps Performed

1. Signed up for a free ProtonVPN account.
2. Installed the ProtonVPN desktop client on Windows.
3. Connected to a Netherlands server using “Quick Connect.”
4. Verified IP address change using https://whatismyipaddress.com.
5. Browsed securely while VPN was active.
6. Disconnected and compared before/after IP and speed.

## 📸 Screenshots Included
- VPN connected status in ProtonVPN
- IP address before and after VPN connection

## 🔐 What is a VPN?
A **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** encrypts all internet traffic and routes it through a secure tunnel to protect user privacy and security. It hides your real IP address and location while preventing third-party tracking.

## ✅ Benefits of VPN:
- Masks real IP address and location
- Encrypts online activity
- Protects data on public Wi-Fi
- Bypasses geo-restrictions and censorship

## ⚠️ Limitations of VPN:
- Can reduce internet speed
- Free VPNs may log activity
- Not a full substitute for antivirus or firewall
- Does not protect from phishing or malware directly

## 📖 VPN Protocols Used by ProtonVPN:
- WireGuard
- OpenVPN
- IKEv2/IPSec

## 📁 Files Included
- `vpn_usage_report.txt` – Detailed report of activity and findings
- `vpn_connected_screenshot.png` – Screenshot of VPN client status
- `ip_check_before_after.png` – Screenshot of IP verification

## ✅ Outcome
Successfully installed and used a VPN. Verified secure, encrypted browsing and IP masking. Understood core VPN use cases, limitations, and protocols.
